Our department has an internal sharing once a week. The initial intention was that everyone could sink their own insights and share them with everyone. After running for more than a year, it turns out that most of the sharing is done by a fixed number of people. Even after attending QCon, ArchSummit, and other high-quality conferences that lasted two or three days, few people came forward to share.

For engineers, how to dare to stand out and what aspects to prepare a technical presentation? I talk about some of my own ideas.

### **Mentaldisorder**

Yes, this one is the most important, **overcoming mental barriers**! What we talk about later are techniques, the art, and this is the way. You must first be unafraid to speak, and then happy to speak.

Speech, as the name implies, is first ** acting ** then speak. Speech has no standard, for example, I think Lao Luo is the miracle of speech, his speech does not meet the requirements of the art, but has its own distinctive characteristics, everywhere there is baggage, highly infectious.

How to overcome the psychological barrier of being afraid to speak? I can only say that it varies from person to person. You first have to analyze the reason why you are afraid, is it because you are not sure of your heart, or you are worried about being ridiculed, or you have an unhappy memory?

Most of the reasons are the same, reluctance to leave the **comfort zone**, fear of bad speech to lose face. There is no elixir for this, the only thing that might work is to think back on what you have brought to the table because of shamelessness, that is, the experience of having jumped out of your comfort zone before. For example, the previous shift from being afraid to sing to a wheat bully, or the shift from being afraid of water to enjoying swimming ......

If you rack your brain and do not come up with similar, please turn off this article, the latter of which you read is not useful.

You can use the experience of your previous transformation to encourage yourself, and this time you can also experience the sense of accomplishment of stepping out of your comfort zone.

### **Transcripts and internal exercises**

Put down all the content of your own presentation in words, not just which outline on top of the slides. It may seem dumb, but it's good for reflection and contemplation.

A ten-minute speech, if written down in words, can take about an hour. The speed of typing can not keep up with the speed of speaking, the time difference between them, your brain will weigh the wording and logical integrity, and the black and white will give you some pressure, do not dare to talk nonsense.

But don't try to memorize the speech, it will make you even more nervous and fill your head with thoughts of what the next sentence will be.

The following will require more rehearsals, my experience is that at least two: first find a few familiar colleagues, in front of acquaintances will relax some, let them listen to give some advice, generally speaking will do a lot of adjustment; then find some more colleagues to share, to see what points they are concerned about, to raise some questions, so that targeted preparation.

Before you share, you need to remind your colleagues who are listening and ask them to help focus on their own **eyes, speech rate and small movements**. These are the three that are hard to perceive on your own, but most affect the aura and first impression.

### **Simple PPT**

The PPT is only an aid to the presentation, allowing the audience on stage to better follow your presentation. If the audience's attention is diverted to the PPT, your presentation will fail.

For example, posting code. I have heard several presentations on posting code, the speaker may be very high, the following people are either asleep, or looking at their phones. Why? Because they can't understand! Several screens of dense code, it is impossible to understand in a short time, and the speaker believes that the audience is low level, high and low. In fact, a good speech is to make people think, take the initiative to learn, and post code plays the opposite role.

Another example: It's all text. What the speaker says, is read out from the PPT, then everyone's attention is on the text, will have to take out their phones to take a picture, basically do not need to listen to you speak.

### **Impromptu Presentations**

This is the exact opposite approach to a text draft, speaking without interruption while thinking on the fly, your brain doesn't have time to draw all kinds of borders to limit you, so from time to time a lot of great ideas will pop up that you didn't think of before.

I enjoy impromptu speaking now because I don't know what I'm going to say out loud, and the unknown is always exciting.

How do you go about training? It's really simple. You can write several sharing topics, draw lots before each sharing to decide which one to share, and then speak for the full ten minutes without PPT.

### **The end**

The most important thing is to **have fun** and get pleasure from the presentation, otherwise it's all just a floating cloud.
