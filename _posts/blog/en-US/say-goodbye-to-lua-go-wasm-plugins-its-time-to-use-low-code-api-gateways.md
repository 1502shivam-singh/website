This is a unique Apache APISIX "plug-in orchestration" feature that allows more than 40 plug-ins of Apache APISIX to share context and link up through drag-and-drop interface. In the above example, we have implemented a new "honeypot" plugin.

**From now on, say goodbye to hand-written plugins. Welcome to the era of Apache APISIX's original low-code API gateway!**

We will continue to share the specific implementation of the plugin orchestration and low code later.
